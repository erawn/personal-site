Quickpose is a version control system for Processing. Think of it like ***a version control system inside of a canvas editor***. Quickpose displays all the versions of your sketch in a browser window alongside your code editor, so you can quickly iterate, experiment, and return to a previous train of thought.

Quickpose was developed by [Eric Rawn](https://www.ericrawn.media/), a PhD Student at UC Berkeley. If you're interested in Quickpose I'd love to chat! Shoot me an email at erawn (at) berkeley (dot) edu.
