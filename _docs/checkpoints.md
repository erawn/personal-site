title: 'checkpoints'

| On every save, Quickpose saves a copy of your sketch code locally. You can see this with the number in the bottom right corner of each version: | <img src="/assets/quickpose/checkpoints.png" style="width:600px;"> |

Checkpoints are meant to be emergency solutions when you've accidentally overwritten a value or a few lines. As such, you'll have to manually retrieve them (for now at least!) from your Quickpose folder. To do that, open up your sketch folder and find the current version (in the **/Quickpose/** directory, all versions are labeled **_{id}**) and look in the **/checkpoints/** directory. 

Personally, I've found that after using Quickpose for a bit, I get into the habit of forking *before* I make any changes, and don't have to use Checkpoints nearly as much. As such, checkpoints are primarily intended as a cushion to help you transition to working within Quickpose without fear that you've lost something during a coding session.
