Export by color allows you to export the code and render outputs for all of your versions which have been given a certain color in the Quickpose canvas. Click the Green project title bar at the top of the canvas to get to this menu:

<img src="/assets/quickpose/exportbycolor2.png" style="width:fit;">

You'll find a folder with the code and **render.png** for each of the versions of that color in your **/Quickpose/exports/** directory with the renders at the top level of the folder and also within each version folder.
