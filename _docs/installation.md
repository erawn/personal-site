To Install Manually:

1. [Download The Latest Version Here](https://ericrawn.media.quickpose)
2. Unzip inside your sketchbook folder **/Processing/tools/** folder.  If you don't have a **/tools/** directory yet, you'll have to make one. 


To Install With the Tool Manager:

1. Open Processing, navigate to **Menu->Tools->Manage Tools...**
2. Search for Quickpose in the List, and Press **Install**

3. Start Processing and Open up a new blank sketch.
4. Navigate to the **Menu->Tools->Quickpose** (if you don't see Quickpose in the menu, you might have placed it in your Processing *application* folder instead of your *sketchbook* folder - the sketchbook folder is by default in your **/Documents/**)
5. You should see some starter code populate the editor, and a console message appear asking you to navigate to [https://quickpose.ericrawn.media](https://quickpose.ericrawn.media) in your browser.
