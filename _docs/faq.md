### Are my files remotely stored anywhere?

Nope! The web browser interface is simply a convenient way to serve a front-end app. All of your files are stored in the **/Quickpose/** folder inside each of your sketches. Quickpose stores everything in a human-readable, uncompressed format to support Processing artists building their own tools or automation scripts on top of Quickpose (I'd love to see what you make if you do!) and also to give transparency about what data is being recorded locally. For a complete look at how Quickpose stores information, take a look at [the full writeup on Github](https://github.com/erawn/Quickpose/wiki/What-happens-when-you-run-Quickpose-on-a-Processing-Project)

**Although Quickpose is a version control system, it is not a remote backup.** You should still make regular backups of your projects in case of a loss of files. This should be pretty easy though, as everything is contained locally in your sketch folder under the **/Quickpose/** directory.

### What should I do if I run into a bug?

Please open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/erawn/Quickpose/issues) with a complete description, and upload your Quickpose folder if you're able. Apologies if there's a delay in addressing bugs - I'm just a single grad student */cry*. 

### I want to use Quickpose for teaching/research/something else cool!

That would make me so happy! If you want to talk over your specific ideas/needs, or are interested in a potential collaboration, please send me a message at erawn (at) berkeley (dot) edu and we can setup a time to chat! 

If you end up doing something cool with Quickpose, I'd love to hear about it too!
