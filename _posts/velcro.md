title: 'Let It Rip! Using Velcro for Acoustic Labeling '
excerpt: 'Different shapes of velcro make slightly different sounds when ripped, which we trained a model to recognize. We argue that Velcro presents opportunities for passive acoustic activity labeling, based on sounds already in our enviornment'

We present an early stage prototype of an acoustic labeling system using Velcro, a two-sided household adhesive product. We create labels by varying the shape of Velcro pieces to produce distinct sounds when the two sides are separated, and we use an automatic audio classification pipeline to detect and classify small sets of labels. We evaluate our classifier on four sets of three simple Velcro labels, present a demo highlighting potential use cases of these labels, and discuss future applications.
