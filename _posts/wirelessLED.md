Mesh-networked wireless lighting controllers sync lighting animations together as they come in and out of range of each other. IR remotes toggle cues on the network. Each unit can power up to 10m of LEDs, with a mobile battery pack or wired power. Piezo sensors connect to a signal conditioning circuit to trigger animations based on nearby vibrations.

The goal for this project was to create a lighting system that was dynamic and robust, capable of sustaining any individual unit loss or disconnection. Units were intended to move around each other, form their own networks, and merge networks as groups of controllers approached one another. Custom PCB design, network protocol, lighting cues, and laser cut housings.
