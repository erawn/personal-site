title: 'Beyond the Artifact: Power as a Lens for Creativity Support Tools'
excerpt: 'When we see a creativity support tool (CST), we should see a power relationship. From interviews with 11 creative practitioners and tool designers, we build a preliminary theory of how power relationships can manifest in CSTs, and what we could do about it.'

Researchers who build creativity support tools (CSTs) define abstractions
and software representations that align with user needs
to give users the power to accomplish tasks. However, these specifications
also structure and limit how users can and should think,
act, and express themselves. Thus, tool designers unavoidably exert
power over their users by enacting a “normative ground” through
their tools. Drawing on interviews with 11 creative practitioners,
tool designers, and CST researchers, we offer a definition of empowerment
in the context of creative practice, build a preliminary
theory of how power relationships manifest in CSTs, and explain
why researchers have had trouble addressing these concepts in the
past. We re-examine CST literature through a lens of power and
argue that mitigating power imbalances at the level of technical
design requires enabling users in both vertical movement along
levels of abstraction as well as horizontal movement between tools
through interoperable representations. A lens of power is one possible
orientation that lets us recognize the methodological shifts
required towards building “artistic support tools.”
