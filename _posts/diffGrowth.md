An exploration into modeling a natural phenomena in Houdini.

I implemented a stable solver to grow an arbitrary mesh according to a geodesic distance heuristic.

Incorporating various kinds of noise into the distance parameter allows for a wide range of patterns. While limiting it’s growth to an arbitrary mesh allows the solver to fill any shape.
