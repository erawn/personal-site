title: 'Understanding Version Control as Material Interaction with
Quickpose'
excerpt: 'Working with materials involves iteration, reflection, and tacit knowledge building. For creative coders, we argue that version control systems are one way to support thinking about code like a material and built Quickpose to see how. We ran a month-long study with Processing artists, using their versions to chart their creative process.'

Whether a programmer with code or a potter with clay, practitioners
engage in an ongoing process of working and reasoning with
materials. Existing discussions in HCI have provided rich accounts
of these practices and processes, which we synthesize into three
themes: (1) reciprocal discovery of goals and materials, (2) local
knowledge of materials, and (3) annotation for holistic interpretation.
We then apply these design principles generatively to the
domain of version control to present Quickpose: a version control
system for creative coding. In an in-situ, longitudinal study
of Quickpose guided by our themes, we collected usage data, version
history, and interviews. Our study explored our participantsâ€™
material interaction behaviors and the initial promise of our proposed
measures for recognizing these behaviors. Quickpose is an
exploration of *version control as material interaction*, using existing
discussions to inform domain-specific concepts, measures, and
designs for version control systems.
