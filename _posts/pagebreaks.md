title: 'Pagebreaks: Multi-Cell Scopes in Computational Notebooks'
excerpt: 'Global variables in computational notebooks are confusing, but notebook users are reluctant to use functions. We understand why and built a new way to express scopes in notebooks. In a month-long in-situ study, we explore the different ways scopes organize code for our participants.'
